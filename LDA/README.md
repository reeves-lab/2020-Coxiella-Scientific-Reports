# Linear Discriminant Analysis
Linear discriminant analysis per day (folder) of DR3 mice. Analysis considered combinations of 3 clusters for predicting class assignment and subsequent projection of results as a density distribution.

*Note: parameters (variables) are first filtered on the basis of absolute value of log odds coefficient from elastic net regression (see other folders)*
